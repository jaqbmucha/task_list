# Task List- homework
## Assumptions
### Step 1
We were instructed to recreate a simple task List using HTML, CSS and JS (using methods we have learned so far). 

### Step 2
We need to add transitions (as we have learned). And buttons: one that hide done tasks, and second that mark all of tasks as done.

### What i have done:
```sh
[05/21/2021]
- I have reworked my task-list. CHanged a little bit of HTML (now text is on span, not paragraph), deleted some DIV and changed CSS to match the settings.
- Added transition to body, all of buttons and scale transition for submit button.
```
